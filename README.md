# Pathfinder
Pathfinder is the name of my line-following robot for my end of year Level 3 Engineering project.

Deliver_crate.ino is the main code used.

I have not done any documentation but i do plan to do so.
Please forgive me :(
This will include further code, design files and list of equipment.
